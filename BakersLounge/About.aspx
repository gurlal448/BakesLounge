							Our Story
						</h3>

						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
							Baker's lounge was first opened in June 2001. We aim to be a village bakery serving local people and passers-by attracted by smell of freshly baked bread, sweets and food. All our baked goods are made on premises. Our breads are made using sourdough starters and long cold fermentation resulting in complex flavour, longer shelf life and improved digestibility.

						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
							In 2001, Roger and Lesley Gillespie opened the first Bakers Delight in Hawthorn, Victoria. Since then, we’ve been delighting our customers every day with delicious, freshly baked bread. From our classic loaves to our artisanal sourdoughs, our bread is baked fresh every day using traditional recipes and real ingredients.</p>

<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">Still proudly family owned, Bakers Delight is now Australia’s most successful bakery franchise and can be found in more than 700 locations across Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand.</p>

							Our Mission
						</h3>

						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
							To be a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be, by encouraging creativity and innovation.

To be a true leader in thought and action and ensure that all stakeholders in our business; whether large or small; cherish and value the relationship.
						</p>

						<div class="bor16 p-l-29 p-b-9 m-t-22">
							<p class="stext-114 cl6 p-r-40 p-b-11">
								So much business is based on the belief that we should do whatever we can within legal limits to make as much money as we can. Ben & Jerry's was based on values, and we try to operate a business that not just sells cake but partners with all our stakeholders - whether that's suppliers or customers - to bring about a more sustainable world.
